                The Binmaley School of Fisheries, a National Secondary Fishery School was established by virtue of R.A 865 and started with an annual appropriation of only P50,000.00. It was the first public secondary school in the town of Binmaley. It started its first operation during the School Year 1960-1961 with only fifty-eight (58) first year students and six (6) strong teachers under the late Mr. Adlofo M. Aldan, the first Principal of the school. The first school sight was in Barangay Baybay Lopez, Binmaley, Pangasinan. The building which served as classrooms was the 2-storey resident of the late Arturo A. Bravo, a security personnel of the school. After 3 years of operation, the school was transferred at the seashore of the same barangay with a building made up of “Sawali and Nipa”. I was a very simple beginning but as they say “Great things start at small beginnings.”

                In 1965, five years after its humble beginnings, the school was able to acquire an eight-hectare land at San Isidro Norte in which a portion of it was donated by the late Imigdio Bravo, former Municipal Counselor Binmaley. This place which is one kilometre away from the town proper finally became the permanent site of Binmaley School of Fisheries. Concrete building were constructed around fishponds, school grounds were developed, fishponds were grown with fisheries and employees as well as students have increased. This was under the administration of Mr. Vicente Viray, the school’s 2nd Principal.

            <p>
                By virtue of R.A 4335, the Binmaley School of Fisheries was changed to Pangasinan College of Fisheries under the sponsorship of the late Congressman Angel B. Fernandez of the 2nd District of Pangasinan and was approved by Fisheries Education and Post-Secondary Education Program under the initiative of the late Mr. Apolinario S. Collado, the 3rd Principal of the School. The school was authorized to offer Technical Courses to High School graduates with Fish Culture, Fish Capture, and Fish Processing as specializations.

                In 1979, a remarkable transition was witnessed when the school was divided into two. Half of its land, building as well as employee were transferred to Pangasinan State University. It was a hard-long adjustment to the school but was able to be managed through the leadership of Mr Col-.

                Another historical chapter of the school was when it was absorbed by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) in 1997, as one of its administered schools. This was during the administration of the late Dr. Rosario B. De Vera the 4th Principal of the school. Not so long TESDA-DepEd joint Memorandum Circular No. 1 Series of 2001 was issued which directed TESDA to rationalize the secondary enrolment and transfer its jurisdiction and supervision of the secondary education program to the Department of Education.

            <p>
                In order to have the school’s original identity, after its transfer to DepEd, PCF was immediately renamed to its original name “BINMALEY SCHOOL OF FISHERIES” under the Municipal Ordinance No 4 Series 2006.

                The school was fortunate enough to have alumnus and its former Guidance Counselor to take charge of the school in the person of Mr. Ferdinand S. Bravo, the 5th Principal with Mr. Bravo at the helm, the school welcomed the opening of a transformed BSF envisioned to be the school of Commitment, Progress and Excellence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mr.Bravo’s administration marked tremendous growth in terms of infrastructure, student population, manpower resources and outstanding achievement. More teaching and non-teaching staff were added to the organization. Most of the staff were upgraded, more buildings were constructed, classroom were renovated and structured, fishpond, parks and gardens were developed and maintained.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students were involved in many campuses, division and region wide activities and students clubs and organization. Winnings were received in the fields of Campus Journalism, Arts, Sports, Scouting and Vocational Technology. Drum and lyre was organized ready for execution during programs in and outside the school. Alternative Learning System (ALS) was also launched and managed to operate successfully in the school.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the administration of Mr. Armando Q. Lopez, the 6th Principal of the school, BSF remained to be a part of nation building as it is presently implementing the Strengthened Technical Vocational Education Program (STVEP), a program o support the department thrust of productive, relevant and quality vocational education. The school continuously undertakes the responsibility of educating students under its well trained teachers to equip them with knowledge, skills and right attitude needed for higher education and to prepare them in the world of work and entrepreneurship. Several infrastructure was also built, facilities were enhanced to provide quality educations to students.

                Like a butterfly that undergoes metamorphosis, Binmaley School of Fisheries has also gone through different ages-from larva to pupa to a beautiful and strong butterfly. The year 2018 marked as a transformational history of BSF as the second human leader rules its administrative and educational system.
                Dr. Rosario C. Ferrer, the school’s 7th Principal, envisions BSF as a center of academic excellence and a forerunner of technical vocational education in the region.  From the start of her stint, she clearly laid the objectives and expedient steps towards the school’s vision. She keeps on remaining the stakeholders to upload the brand of being a “SCHOOL OF FISHERIES”.
                The “iron lady” has started different projects such as Literacy/ Reading and Numeracy Program and Gulayan sa Paaralan, improvement of physical facilities, staff empowerment, strengthened technical vocational programs and strong connection of BSF alumni.
                She also targets the rehabilitation of fishponds and fingerings for a more interesting and convenient learning and increase in school’s generating income.
